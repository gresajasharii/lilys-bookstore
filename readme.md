These functions handle the core interactivity of the bookstore app:

  Adds a book to the cart and updates both the UI and localStorage.

- `renderCart()`  
  Renders all items in the cart to the cart section and updates total.

- `updateMiniCartTotal()`  
  Syncs the top navbar mini-cart total with the cart's total value.

- `clearCart()`  
  Clears the cart from localStorage and resets the cart display.

- `showGenre(genre)`  
  Dynamically shows the selected book genre and hides others.

# Screenshots

This is the first screen users see. A carousel with bookstore-themed images invites visitors to explore the collection. The "SHOP NOW" button scrolls directly to the book genres.

Clicking “Add to Cart” updates the mini cart in the navbar and adds the book to the cart list. The cart section at the bottom of the page shows all selected books, with the total dynamically updated and persisted using LocalStorage.
